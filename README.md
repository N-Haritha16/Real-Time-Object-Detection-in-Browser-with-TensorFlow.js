# Real-Time Object Detection in Browser

This project detects objects like people, animals, and things in real-time using your webcam or images you upload. It uses TensorFlow.js and a pre-trained model called COCO-SSD â€” all running directly in your web browser. No backend or API keys needed!

## Features

- Detects objects live from your webcam  
- Detects objects in uploaded images  
- Shows boxes and labels around detected objects  
- Works fully in the browser for fast and private detection

3. Run a local server (for example, with Python) 
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`  
5. Allow webcam access to see live detection  
6. Upload images to test image detection

## Tech Used

- TensorFlow.js  
- COCO-SSD model  
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS
